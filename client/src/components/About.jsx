      <p>Hi! I'm a detail-oriented web developer with an emphasis in design. I'm currently finishing up my bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development, and for the past year and a half I have been building websites that merge clean functionality with thoughful, user-centered design. My background in both coding and creativity helps me craft digital experiences that not only work well but also feel intuitive and engaging.</p>
      <p>I love learning new things. Recently, I havr been exploring the backend of web services, learning how to create custom APIs, connect to databases, and more. It's been really intersting to learn REACT as well, which this portfolio is based in!</p>
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can usually find me exploring new trails, diving into a good game, or trying out something new. Recently that new thing has been photography! I'm always learning, always building, and always excited to take on the next challenge.</p>
